# Node.js Learning Projects 

This repository contains a collection of small projects and exercises created during my learning journey with **Node.js**.

Each project focuses on a specific concept of Node, starting from the fundamentals and gradually moving toward more advanced topics.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:
- Practice core Node.js concepts
- Apply theory through small, practical projects
- Track my progress and learning path over time

This is not a single application, but a **learning repository**.

## Topics Covered

Some of the topics explored in these projects include:
- Node.js basics
- Modules (CommonJS and ES Modules)
- Asynchronous programming (Promises, async/await)
- Core modules (`fs`, `path`, `http`, etc.)
- CLI tools with Node
- Good practices and project structure

More topics will be added as my learning continues.

## Repository Structure

Each folder represents an independent project or exercise:
